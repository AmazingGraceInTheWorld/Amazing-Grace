<h2><strong>Amazing Grace</strong><br />
<em>John Newton, 1779</em></h2>

<p>Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,<br />
That saved a wretch like me!<br />
I once was lost, but now am found,<br />
Was blind, but now I see.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,<br />
And grace my fears relieved;<br />
How precious did that grace appear<br />
The hour I first believed!</p>

<p>The Lord has promised good to me,<br />
His word my hope secures;<br />
He will my shield and portion be<br />
As long as life endures.</p>

<p>Through many dangers, toils, and snares<br />
I have already come;<br />
&lsquo;Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,<br />
And grace will lead me home.</p>

<p>When we&rsquo;ve been there ten thousand years,<br />
Bright shining as the sun,<br />
We&rsquo;ve no less days to sing God&rsquo;s praise<br />
Than when we first begun.</p>
